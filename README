This is an implementation of a searchable BTree in pure Ruby. This was purely a
programming exercise for myself. Normally a BTree would be used to speed up searching
for values in large datasets. However this implementation is much slower than Ruby's
underlying C implementation of Array#find. This code is not production worthy and should 
only be referenced as an example of a BTree implementation.
